        Take all diff values, put them in a list.

        algorithm.

        Return the max diff value, the worst match, and then
        the second max value, i.e. the 2nd worst match. This
        would allow me to prefer a set that has 3 great matches
        and one bad one, over a set that has potentially 4 bad matches..

        Consider two cases:
          0.5,0.6,0.5,0.6

          0.1,0.0,0.2,0.6

        In the previous algorithm, they are the same... here, the second
        one could be preferred.
