<13:35 vtrtl> maybe you should concentrate ongetting the answer you need
> not having your math background... I've been trying (for six months)... to
+fiure out how to "brute force this"..
<13:35 vtrtl> if you wanted a heurisitc for making several good pairings
<13:36 vtrtl> do the thing with the diagonals
<13:36 vtrtl> (first sort the players by ability)
<13:36 vtrtl> or maybe interleave th eplayers by ability....
<13:36 vtrtl> 15 26 37 48
<13:37 vtrtl> then you could build a nice portfolio of good matchups for a
+bunch of fridays
<13:37 vtrtl> also
<13:37 vtrtl> the problem is really sensitive to ratings... and ratings are
+probably only so good...
<13:37 vtrtl> if everyone has a rating in the range 3.9 to 4.1 than who
+cares..
<13:38 vtrtl> if most people are 4+ and a couple of them are 1.3 or
+something... then the problem is reallly "who plays with the partner who
+sucks this friday?
> there is a fair bit of variation in the ratings actually.
> we have 3.5 men, and 5.0 men..
<13:39 vtrtl> there is a microsoft solver foundation that is open source you
+could make a asp .net web app and use that as the back end solver
> 3.5 women that are probaly more like "3.0" and 4.0 women that are higher..
<13:40 vtrtl> welll then given that the optimization is probably a good thing
+to have...
<13:40 vtrtl> even if you just get an optimal pairing every once in awhle
+(when membership and ratings change)
<13:40 vtrtl> that gives you something to go on...
<13:41 vtrtl> it tells you "the best possbile" combnation - even if you are
+not doing that this friday... you know how far from theoretical optimality
+you are...
<13:41 vtrtl> also...
<13:41 vtrtl> you need to ask people whether they thought the experience is
+better or worse under this program...
<13:41 vtrtl> what really constitues the "best" paring is way different that
+what th eobjective function says...
<13:42 vtrtl> some dude may want a great workout and he may get it with a weak
+partner...
<13:42 vtrtl> have to run around a lot more...
<13:42 vtrtl> some people may prize winning over all else... they would be
+happy with weak opponents every friday...
<13:42 vtrtl> is mokus around?
<13:43 vtrtl> i hve to get back to work on my project
<13:43 vtrtl> (my realy project)
<13:43 donnarona> bye guys
<13:44 vtrtl> bye
<13:44 donnarona> we will let you know about dads test
> thanks for all the hel.. I need to think about your info..
<13:44 vtrtl> yes do
<13:44 donnarona> k
